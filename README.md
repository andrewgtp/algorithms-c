## Overview

The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate algorithms in C based on a fork from Kyle Louden's book Mastering Algorithms in C. 

## Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/andrewgtp/algorithms-c
$ cd algorithms-c
```
CMake Install Instructions: [here](https://cmake.org/install/)


### Mac Users
```
brew install cmake
```

## Run Examples

### From the command line

```
$ cmake CMakeLists.txt
```

### From CLion (JetBrains)
Import algorithms-c project
build and run examples separately


## Exercises
Unlike the rest of this repo where examples are separated into source, include and examples directories, in the exercises directory you will find standalone files with all the code necessary to run one data type or algorithm.

TBD:
Add additional exercises replacing code with statements, ascii diagrams for the user to fill in as practice.


## Copyright/Disclaimer

This repo contains some code from the book "Mastering Algorithms with C",  published by O'Reilly & Associates
plus several examples illustrating how to use it.  All of the code was written
to be platform independent, with a few minor exceptions.  It has been compiled
and tested  on the platforms listed below,  but it should work  on others with
little or no modification.

source or  binary form, so long as an acknowledgment appears in derived source
files. The citation should list that the code comes from the  book  "Mastering
Algorithms with C"  by Kyle Loudon,  published by O'Reilly & Associates.  This
